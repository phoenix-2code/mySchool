MySchool Portal

Built step by step, with curiosity, questions, and determination.

This is a PHP-based academic portal I designed and developed as part of my journey into web development and backend integration. 
I wasn’t trying to show off full-stack mastery — I was trying to understand how things work: 
      -1.How users explore courses
      -2.How forms handle input
      -3.How databases connect to real people’s decisions.

Why I Made This

I wanted something practical, something human. An education portal that makes things clear for a student — not just an admin.
The goal was to combine everything I was learning about PHP, HTML, MySQL, Bootstrap, and Human-Computer Interaction into one working system that I could break, fix, and eventually trust.

What It Does:
- Lets students explore programs, campuses, modes of study
- Supports admissions through a real-time form (with validation)
- Highlights upcoming intakes, financing options, and campus info
- Includes a search engine that cuts across all pages
- Mobile responsive and structured for clarity

How I Built It

I used:
PHP and MySQL for logic and database
Bootstrap for styling and structure
XAMPP locally for testing
- Lots of feedback, learning moments, and Google searches

I worked on features one at a time: writing, failing, re-reading, and improving.
Every page taught me something — whether about input handling, form spacing, or how HCI really means thinking about people first.

It’s not a polished SaaS tool — it’s a student-built, curiosity-powered system with room to grow.

Credits & Thanks

Thanks to:
- The Lord my God
- Everyone who shares code, ideas, and encouragement online
- The people who explained the little things that helped make the big things work
- The quiet process of trial, error, and finally… success

 Final Thought

I didn’t just build a school portal. I built a learning archive — a record of what it’s like to figure things out in real time. 
If you’re learning, too, feel free to explore it, break it, and build something better from it.
